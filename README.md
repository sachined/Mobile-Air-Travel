# Mobile-Air-Travel
 A game in which goods and people travel. You will make money and eventually buy more planes to make even more!

Language used: C++

November 18, 2020 : Base class (airPort) uploaded with functional class (mapQueue). Defined w/ cpp & hpp for readability and ease of debugging.
                    Currently creating sort functions for airPort pointers. There is a bug with the remove function (mapQueue), in which the location 
                    of prev. occupied airport is still occupied by prev. in the mapQueue object. 
                    
            Plans - Finish making the sort functions, create few additional classes, such as Plane, Person, & Goods.
                    Start on an outline for integration of graph, to connect the airPorts. Distance is the important factor.
